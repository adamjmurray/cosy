Cosy
a COmpact Sequencing sYntax

http://compusition.com/web/software/cosy


== Description ==
Cosy is a domain specific language (DSL) for composing musical patterns and
general purpose sequencing.


== Status ==
This project is very immature. The syntax is not finalized, so I can't
guarantee I won't change it in a way that will break backward compatibility.
There are probably lots of bugs right now. 
Use at your own risk!


== Dependencies ==
Cosy depends on the following Ruby libraries:
* treetop (which depends on polyglot)
* midilib 
* midiator

To run Cosy you will need to install the gems for those libraries:
gem install treetop
gem install midilib
gem install midiator

midiator-0.3.0 or higher is needed for direct output on OS X


== Running Cosy ==
Currently there are two main use cases for Cosy:
* Generating MIDI files
* Running Cosy inside Max/MSP

An executable script is provided to generate MIDI files from Cosy syntax:
bin/cosy2midi
Run this script with no arguments for usage instructions.
Some example input files are provided in the examples folder (TODO add more!)

To run things inside Max/MSP right now you unfortunately need the latest
version of my ajm.ruby object which I have no released yet. I will be
moving my Max project to github at some point so people can grab the latest
development version of that project. In the meantime, if you are interested
in using this with Max/MSP email me and I can hook you up.

In the future I plan to allow for generating MIDI and OSC messages in
realtime. I am also considering adding renderers for csound and lilypond.


== Documentation ==
Currently the closest thing to documentation is the examples for the online
preview at:
