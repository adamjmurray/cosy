-- Using a foreach loop with an interval sequence

(C4:ei F4 G4 C4)@($ M2 m2 p5 -M2 -m2)

-- This means for each pitch C4,F4,G4,C4 do the following:
-- play the starting pitch, the pitch a major 2nd above that, 
-- then a minor 2nd above that, a perfect 5th above,
-- major 2nd down, and a minor 2nd down
--
-- In other words, it's the same as this sequence:
-- (C4:ei D4 Eb4 Bb4 Ab4 G4) (F4 G4 Ab4 Eb5 Db5 C) 
-- (G4 A4 Bb4 F5 Eb5 D5) (C4 D4 Eb4 Bb4 Ab4 G4)
