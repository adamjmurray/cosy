These examples can be converted to a MIDI file with the bin/cosy command.

Run bin/cosy with no arguments for usage instructions.

-- Cosy input files can have comments by starting a line with two hyphens,
## or two hash marks, like these lines.

### I like to use 3 or more hash marks to avoid any chance of confusion with
### Cosy's #label syntax.
