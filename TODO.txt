Introduce rake or something for running all unit tests, maybe generating the parser so I don't
incur penality for that in Max


infinite loops: 
   (c4 g4)*@


	Patterns for rhythm:
	X...X...
	....X.X.
	
	

	*** support negative duration for rests
	otherwise I can't do things like C4:(4 -1 3)

	reuse last octave c4 d e f g e c
  I don't think this is possible because f is loud velocity!

	reuse last pitch: C4:5 :3 :4 :4
	


	-----
	NOTES:
	() a sequence, can be implicit
	
	[] a single event parameter, usually implicit. useful when the parameter is a list such as a list of pitches for a chord
	
	: connects parameter sequences for a multi-parameter event generator
	
  <> a command (specify base duration value, default octave, scale, sequence types (pitch,vel,dur) to enable special parsing rules, and ...???)
